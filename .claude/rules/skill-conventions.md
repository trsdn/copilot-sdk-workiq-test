# Skill File Conventions

When creating or editing skill files:

## Frontmatter Requirements

- `name` must match the parent directory name
- `description` should explain when to use the skill (max 1024 chars)
- Include optional fields only when needed

## Content Guidelines

- Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines
- Use clear section headings
- Include practical examples
- Reference supporting files from within the skill

## Naming Pattern

- Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only
- 1-64 characters
- No leading/trailing hyphens
- No consecutive hyphens
